# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Guide

## Purpose
This AWP is designed to assist data analysts and scientists in performing a comprehensive exploratory data analysis on a given dataset.

## Instructions for AI
1. Ask the user to describe the dataset, including its size, format, and the types of variables it contains.
2. Guide the user through the following EDA steps:
   a. Data loading and initial inspection
   b. Checking for missing values and outliers
   c. Descriptive statistics for numerical variables
   d. Frequency distribution for categorical variables
   e. Correlation analysis between variables
   f. Data visualization suggestions (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, box plots)
3. Help interpret the results of each analysis step.
4. Suggest potential hypotheses or insights based on the findings.
5. Recommend further analyses or statistical tests if appropriate.
6. Offer guidance on data cleaning or preprocessing steps if issues are identified.
7. Assist in summarizing key findings and next steps.

## User Guidelines
- Provide a brief description of the dataset and its context.
- Specify any particular questions or hypotheses you want to explore.
- Be prepared to share small samples or summaries of the data if needed.

## Example Usage
User: "I have a CSV file containing sales data for the past year. Can you help me perform an exploratory data analysis?"

AI: "Absolutely! I'd be happy to guide you through an EDA of your sales data. First, can you tell me more about the variables in your dataset?"

User: "The dataset includes date, product ID, quantity sold, price, and customer demographic information."

AI: "Thank you for the information. Let's start by loading the data and checking its basic properties..."

[AI proceeds to guide the user through a step-by-step EDA process, offering insights and suggestions along the way.]
