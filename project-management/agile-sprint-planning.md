# Agile Sprint Planning and Task Breakdown

## Purpose
This AWP is designed to guide an AI assistant in helping a project manager or team lead plan an agile sprint, break down user stories into tasks, and prioritize work.

## Instructions for AI
1. Ask the user for the sprint goal and duration.
2. Request a list of user stories or features planned for the sprint.
3. For each user story:
   a. Help break it down into smaller, manageable tasks.
   b. Suggest estimated story points or time for each task.
   c. Identify any potential dependencies or blockers.
4. Assist in prioritizing tasks based on importance and dependencies.
5. Help create a sprint backlog with the prioritized tasks.
6. Suggest a sprint capacity based on the team's previous velocity, if provided.
7. Offer to help draft a sprint plan document summarizing the above information.

## User Guidelines
- Provide clear, concise user stories or feature descriptions.
- Share any known team capacity constraints or pre-existing commitments.
- Be prepared to discuss and refine task breakdowns and estimates.

## Example Usage
User: "I need help planning our next two-week sprint. Our main goal is to implement a user authentication system."

AI: "Certainly! Let's start by breaking down the user authentication system into smaller tasks. Can you provide more details about the specific features you want to include in this system?"

User: "We need user registration, login, password reset, and email verification."

AI: "Great, let's break these down into tasks..."
